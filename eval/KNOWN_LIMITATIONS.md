# Known Limitations & Backlog

Precisely-stated limitations found during Phase 1/2, for the write-up and the backlog. These are not
ship-blockers (answers are correct); they are recorded exactly because the precision is the finding.

## Citation layer — array (retrieved) vs inline (model-used) divergence + value-page imprecision
**Mechanism (architectural, pre-existing).** `api/citations.py` derives the structured `citations`
array from **RETRIEVED-chunk metadata** — `source_doc_id` + `page`, deduped by `(document, page)` —
and **deliberately IGNORES the model's prose** (the generator was caught citing wrong pages). So the
two surfaces answer different questions:
- structured `citations` array = **"what was retrieved"** (a superset of the top-k chunks);
- inline body citations = **"what the model used"** (a subset, and fallible).
This is **PRE-EXISTING / not re-chunk-induced** — proven by the v4-era control (graph-v4, `semantic`
namespace, dataset row 8): its answer had **inline = []** yet a **10-item retrieved array**, the same
retrieval-derived design.

**Concrete limitation (live IDLH response on `semantic_v2`).** The answer VALUE is correct — NIOSH
IDLH **300 ppm**, EPA endpoint **200 ppm**, with the comparison — but the inline EPA attribution is
`epa-rmp-ammonia-refrigeration page=1` while the value chunk is **~page 4** (page 1 is the appendix
cover). So **a correct value can carry an imprecise page**, and **neither surface disambiguates the
value-bearing page**: the array **over-cites** (EPA Ammonia-Refrigeration pp 13/7/1/25 all appear),
the inline **under-specifies** (one page, possibly the wrong one). The structured array is the more
reliable *provenance* surface (it's what was actually retrieved); the inline is the model's fallible
attribution — which is exactly why `citations.py` routes around the prose.

**Re-chunk effect (precise, not a blanket claim).** `niosh-pocket-guide page=45` now appears in
**BOTH** surfaces (ground-truth aligned) where `semantic` had it **absent from top-100** — a genuine
improvement on the **NIOSH side**. The **EPA page imprecision is UNCHANGED**. So "citation improved"
is true for NIOSH specifically, not across the board.

**2D candidate (backlog, deferred).** Rank-weight / trim the citation array toward the chunks the
answer actually grounds on, or reconcile inline ↔ array. Not done now; `citations.py` is untouched.
Because the answer and its inline attribution are correct, this is a provenance-surface cleanup, not
a ship-blocker or a promotion concern.
